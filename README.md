#Hackathon Contest theme - Web app that connects doctors with mental ill patients. This project was created inside a hackthon contest : UniHACK by Liga AC. I collaborated with my friends and colleagues Catalin Candea, Bianca Belea and Victor Toporan. Me, Bianca and Victor
worked on the Frontend side of the application, and Catalin worked on the Backend side of it writing the cose using AppWrite.
